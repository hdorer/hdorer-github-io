Hi! I'm Harry Dorer.  Welcome to my website!

I'm a senior at Champlain College pursuing a Game Programming degree and graduating in 2024.  I like making flexible, easy-to-use gameplay systems that power excitement for players.  I also like teaching myself new skills and technologies.  Most of my work experience so far has been on class projects, including interdisciplinary game production classes which honed my teamwork and communication skills.  I also have a few game jam projects.

You can find examples of my past work in the "Portfolio" tab.  Recruiters may be interested in the "Resume" tab.  If you'd like to get in touch, you can find my GitHub, LinkedIn, and email linked below.

I'm currently working on my college senior game, SYNC.  It is a first-person shooter with fast-paced gameplay that makes you think on your feet.  You play as an AI construct on a mission to stop the rogue AI SynTell from taking over your creators, Unillect.  Using your SYNC ability, you can take over the systems of any enemy in your path, using their advanced firepower to your advantage.

The game is currently in development, and will release on April 29!  Add it to your Steam wishlist in the meantime!
